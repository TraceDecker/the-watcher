## Overview

## Description
_Nowadays, cellphones and technology are a huge part of daily life. But it can be easy to get carried away and lose focus of the task at hand. This is an app that can monitor app usage while the user is at places like school, work, the gym, or even at home too._

## Key Features

* Time limits may be set for certain apps to save you from a 30 minute Facebook binge while you're at work or studying.

* Time limits may be assigned to specific locations, allowing more time for social media and games while the user may be at home, or less/no time while doing more important tasks.

* Can require administrator credentials to change settings.

* "SafeMode" allows users to set a specific hour in which the settings can be changed.(works best for users who want to increase their own productivity.)

## Later Release Goals:

* "Lockdown" while the user is in motion(In vehicle), locks all app functionality, except emergency contacts.

* Device to device connection for superuser control(sorry kids).

## Intended Users
_This app would be for:_

* People who want to increase their daily productivity by limiting device usage in places they maybe shouldn't be using them.

* Parents wanting to monitor and limit their kids device usage at school but maybe not at home.  

* Users who simply want to see how much they user their devices at work or at the gym.
