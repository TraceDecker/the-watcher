## Description
_Nowadays, cellphones and technology are a huge part of daily life. But it can be easy to get carried away and lose focus of the task at hand. This is an app that can monitor app usage while the user is at places like school, work, the gym, or even at home too._
## Intended Users
_This app would be for people who want to increase their daily productivity, parents wanting to monitor their kids device usage, or if you simply want to see how much time you spend using your devices while you maybe should be doing something more important._
## External Services
_The only required external service as of now would be the Google maps API._
